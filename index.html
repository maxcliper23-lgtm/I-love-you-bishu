    <p>Every heartbeat of mine whispers your name. Every day I wake up thankful that you are mine.</p>
    <p>On your birthday, I don’t just celebrate the day you were born — I celebrate the day my life found its meaning.</p>
    <p>You are my calm in chaos, my light in darkness, and my forever favorite feeling.</p>
    <p>Thank you for existing. Thank you for loving me. Thank you for being you.</p>
    <p>I promise to love you not only for this lifetime but for every lifetime to come.</p>
